Had some moments of inspiration so decided to bang out some updates for Generic RPG. 

A lot of changes so bear with me here.

1. Updated the start menu. Gave the start screen background a bit of an overhaul, and added a few additional buttons. Now players can quit from the menu, in addition to checking out who is responsible for the awesome assets I've been using.

2. Fighting feels better than ever. Changed a lot of the logic surrounding the zombie fights, and updated the sword swinging animation. Feels a lot better now in my humble opinion.

3. Hints of a side objective are starting to come around. Still need to add some coins in the Shield and Sword realms, but otherwise the three so far are a good start.

4. Can't believe it took me this long to mention jumping. I decided to go for a momentum based jump that prevents the user from controlling their direction while in the air. Definitely need to play with it more, but its a solid foundation.

There are likely a few more changes that I've made, but these were the main ones that came directly to mind.

Still so many more ideas that I need to finish implementing. Enjoy jumping around in what will eventually be the shield zone, and look forward to the future updates soon™.
