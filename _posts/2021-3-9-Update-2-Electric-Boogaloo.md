Figured after a bit over a month it was time for another update in case anyone stopped by.

As far as the job hunt goes the news is still pretty lackluster. In the process of setting up interviews for various positions, but nothing confirmed yet.

As for the video game development goes, good news! Finally figured out a jumping style that I like for my "Generic RPG" game, so a little expansion should be released for that soon.

Also have been spending a lot of time laying out the design for a large scale project I hope to begin working on soon™, so look out for that! Been contemplating making it my first big Unreal Engine project, but more on that later.

The dream is still to begin a career in Game Development, so please reach out if you feel you could provide me with that opportunity.
