Figured after a bit over two months it was time for another update in case anyone stopped by.

As far as the job hunt goes the news is still pretty lackluster. Still searching, but not getting a ton of hits in the desired areas so its time to expand those job interest parameters.

As for the video game development, I've finally got somewhat good news to share! Finally figured out a jumping style that I like for my "Generic RPG" game, so a little expansion should be released for that soon. The main focus right now is to completely finish the starter town, with a nonexistent timeline for finishing. Hoping that once I lock down a more permanent position I'll be able to relax a bit and enjoy the game dev cycle a bit more.

In other news I've been playing around with Unreal Engine a lot more. No definite projects in the work just yet, but stay tuned for more.

The dream is still to begin a career in Game Development, but something is better than nothing so feel free to reach out if you have any openings.
